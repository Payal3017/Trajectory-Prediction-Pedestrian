## Homography
We manullay calculated a homography matrix: [`H.json`](./H.json)
based on the following information: **"The Main Concourse, is located on the upper platform level of Grand Central, in the geographical center of the station building. The cavernous concourse measures 275 ft (84 m) long by 120 ft (37 m) wide by 125 ft (38 m) high."** (The plan of the station is shown below):

## Load Dataset with Toolkit

```python
import sys, os
# fixme: replace OPENTRAJ_ROOT with the address to root folder of OpenTraj
path = os.path.join({OPENTRAJ_ROOT}, "datasets/GC/Annotation")
traj_dataset = load_gcs(path)
```

### Citation
The videos were originally collected by the authors of the following paper:
